# Path-Sync
## What is Path-Sync?
Path-Sync a simple all-local solution for synchronizing multiple folders that were worked on independently.
A possible use case is editing files on different devices and exchange data over any cloud service.
Path-Sync can then be used on each of these devices to merge the local changes with the state of the cloud.

**NOTE:** Path-Sync only looks to merge the folders in a coherent way but it's NOT a version-control system.

## Installation
To get Path-Sync running, download the repo and run ´odin build .´ inside the folder.
